<code>ðŸ‘·Classic minesweeper game, written on Kotlin in OOP style.</code>

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where the player is presented with a grid of tiles, some of which contain hidden mines. 
The goal of the player is to reveal all the tiles that do not contain mines while avoiding the mines themselves. 
The player can mark tiles, that they suspect contain mines, and can reveal tiles by clicking on them. If a player opens a tile with a mine, he loses the game. 
If the player successfully clears all the tiles without hitting a mine, they win the game
